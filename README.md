# 🚀 Job Application Tracker

A modern dashboard to track job applications, built with **React** and **LocalStorage**.
This project demonstrates CRUD operations, state management with Hooks, and persistent data storage without a backend.

## 🌟 Features

- **Add Applications:** Log new job applications with company name, position, and status.
- **Status Management:** Update application status (Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected).
- **Persistent Data:** Uses a custom `useLocalStorage` hook to save data in the browser. Data remains even after refresh.
- **Visual Indicators:** Dynamic color coding based on application status.
- **Delete Entries:** Remove outdated or unwanted applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** (Vite)
- **React Hooks** (useState, useEffect, Custom Hooks)
- **UUID** (For unique ID generation)
- **CSS3** (Responsive & Clean UI)
